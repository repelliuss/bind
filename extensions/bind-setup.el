;;; Commentary:
;;

;; Adds support for bind.el in setup.el.
;; `:main-file' metadata inserted so `bind-autoload' doesn't need explicit file name.
;; Active map of current setup context is inserted to *first FORM of `bind' FORM if it
;; is insertable. It is insertable if no map is given or a list of maps are given explicitly.
;; For example,
;; (bind c-mode-map "c" #'foo ...), the map won't be inserted.
;; (bind "c" #'foo), the map will be inserted and act like (bind pkg-mode-map "c" #'foo)
;; (bind (c-mode-map) "c" #'foo), the map will be inserted and act like (bind (pkg-mode-map c-mode-map) "c" #'foo).
;; (bind (my-function-returning-maps) "c" #'foo), the map won't be inserted.
;; Note that if there are multiple `bind' FORMS, the first one will be selected.
